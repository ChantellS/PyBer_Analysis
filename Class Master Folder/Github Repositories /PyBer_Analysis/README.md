# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview 
The purpose of this project was to anaylize the ride-sharing data by city type to gain an understanding of PyBer's performance and how they be able to improve services. Using the data to create visualizations that display the diffrent cities in correlation to the average fare for each.

## Results 
Results by city type:

Rural cities have the least activity amongst drivers and overall rides and total fare but make the most amount share per ride.
Urban cities have the most activity amongst drivers and overall rides and total fare but make the least amount share per ride.
Suburban cities the 2nd most actitvity amongst drivers and overall rides and total fare.

## Summary
There are three business recommendations that I have - based on my findings it is necessary to increase the fare per ride in Uban cities due to shorter trips that. way the drivers can make a decent earning and increase revenue for PyBer. Second, rural citites may need more drivers to increase overall fare total and lastly I suggest that increasing total drivers and fare per ride in all cities in the spring months due to slight recorded increase in activity durning that time.
